Stashi Wallet
=====================

Stashi Wallet is a cross-platform Pirate Chain wallet with a Flutter user interface and a Rust core. The repository includes the application, the Rust wallet and sync crates, build scripts, and the project-owned documentation used for release and verification work.

This repository is under active development. Before distributing builds, review the release notes, the security notes, and the verification instructions in `docs/`.

User guide
----------

The [Stashi Wallet User Guide](https://piratenetwork.github.io/Pirate-Unified-Light-Wallet/) covers installation, recovery, payments, privacy, key management, release verification, and troubleshooting for desktop and mobile. Its source is maintained under [`docs/user-guide/`](docs/user-guide/), and GitHub Actions publishes the approved PDF after guide changes reach `main`.

Repository layout
-----------------

- `app/`  
  Flutter application code, desktop packaging hooks, generated localization files, and the desktop updater.
- `crates/`  
  Rust wallet, storage, sync, service, CLI, native FFI, and supporting crates.
- `bindings/`
  Native SDK and bridge wrappers for iOS, Android, and React Native on top of the repo-owned native FFI crate.
- `docs/`  
  Project-owned documentation for security, build verification, and localization.
- `scripts/`  
  Platform build, packaging, SBOM, provenance, and asset-fetch scripts.
- `release-artifacts.toml`
  Version manifest used to decide which backend deliverables should be published on release tags.
- `generate_ffi_bindings.sh`  
  Generates Flutter Rust Bridge bindings for the app and Rust FFI layer.

Supported build outputs
-----------------------

Current build scripts produce the following release artifacts:

- Windows: installer `.exe` and portable `.zip`
- Linux: `.AppImage`, `.flatpak`, and `.deb`
- macOS: `.dmg`
- Android: split APKs and `.aab`
- iOS: `.ipa`

Linux AppImage and Debian releases support Ubuntu 22.04 and newer. Their ABI
contract is glibc 2.35: release builds run on Ubuntu 22.04, Linux i2pd is built
from its current immutable source revision on that same baseline, and CI scans
every bundled ELF before packaging. Flatpak releases use their declared
Freedesktop runtime but pass the same bundled-binary compatibility check.

Additional backend deliverables are built from the Rust workspace:

- `piratewallet-cli` under `crates/piratewallet-cli/`
- `pirate-qortal-cli` under `crates/pirate-qortal-cli/`
- Qortal desktop JNI library under `crates/pirate-qortal-jni/`
- `pirate-ffi-native` under `crates/pirate-ffi-native/`
- iOS SDK XCFramework inputs under `bindings/ios-sdk/`
- Android SDK module and AAR packaging inputs under `bindings/android-sdk/`
- React Native wrapper under `bindings/react-native-pirate-wallet/` with exact-version Android and iOS binary packages alongside it

Backend architecture
--------------------

The shared app-facing wallet backend now lives in:

- `crates/pirate-wallet-service`

The Flutter Rust Bridge crate:

- `crates/pirate-ffi-frb`

is now a thin wrapper surface over that backend for Flutter-specific FFI generation.

The architecture, performance work, and correctness guarantees behind the Supernova shielded-chain sync engine are documented in [`docs/sync-engine.md`](docs/sync-engine.md).

Platform packaging is handled by the scripts in `scripts/`. Use those scripts
for release artifacts; they checksum-prefetch the platform KDF binary and the
SDK-pinned coin snapshot, materialize only its configured JSON and icon paths,
then disable the dependency transformer's network fetches.

For an unpackaged development build, run the same preflight after
`flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile` and before Flutter. For example:

```bash
(cd app && flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile)
bash scripts/prepare-flutter-build.sh windows
(cd app && flutter build windows)
```

Replace `windows` with `android`, `ios`, `linux`, or `macos`. A raw
`flutter build` without this preflight is unsupported: the upstream transformer
may otherwise attempt network downloads or mutate its resolved build config.
The preflight does not disable runtime coin updates.

Run Flutter unit and widget tests through the checked-in wrapper so the asset
transformer is never invoked by the test bundle:

```bash
bash scripts/test-flutter.sh
```

Toolchain
---------

The project is built and tested in CI with these pinned versions:

- Rust `1.90.0`
- Flutter `3.47.2`
- Dart `3.13.2` (bundled with Flutter)
- `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` `2.11.1`
- CocoaPods `1.17.0` for macOS and iOS builds

The Rust pin is defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`. CI pins are defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

To check local tools against the current pins:

```bash
FLUTTER_VERSION=3.47.2 \
DART_VERSION=3.13.2 \
COCOAPODS_VERSION=1.17.0 \
scripts/verify-toolchain.sh
```

Nix flake
---------

The repository includes a checked-in flake that mirrors the committed native build scripts.

Development shells:

```bash
nix develop
nix develop .#ci
nix develop .#build
```

Native flake package outputs:

- Linux hosts:
  - `.#linux-appimage`
  - `.#linux-flatpak`
  - `.#linux-deb`
  - `.#android-apk`
  - `.#android-bundle`
- macOS hosts:
  - `.#macos-dmg`
  - `.#ios-ipa`

Windows packaging is not exposed through the flake. Use `scripts/build-windows.sh` for Windows release artifacts.

Build prerequisites
-------------------

Common requirements:

- Rust toolchain with `rustfmt` and `clippy`
- Flutter stable SDK
- `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
- `protoc`

Platform-specific requirements:

- Windows:
  - Visual Studio 2022 C++ build tools
  - OpenSSL
  - PowerShell
  - Inno Setup if you want the installer artifact
- Linux:
  - Flutter Linux desktop dependencies
  - `flatpak-builder` for Flatpak output
  - `dpkg-deb` and `dpkg-scanpackages` for Debian and APT output
  - `appimagetool` or pinned `APPIMAGETOOL_URL` and `APPIMAGETOOL_SHA256`
  - pinned `APPIMAGE_RUNTIME_URL` and `APPIMAGE_RUNTIME_SHA256` values for
    AppImage output
- macOS:
  - Xcode and CocoaPods
  - Apple signing and notarization credentials for signed distribution
- Android:
  - Android SDK and NDK
  - Java runtime compatible with your Android toolchain
- iOS:
  - macOS
  - Xcode
  - CocoaPods
  - Apple signing configuration for signed IPA export

Getting started
---------------

1. Fetch Flutter dependencies:

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
cd ..
```

2. Generate Flutter Rust Bridge bindings:

```bash
bash generate_ffi_bindings.sh
```

3. Build the target you need.

Release build commands
----------------------

Windows:

```bash
bash scripts/build-windows.sh
```

Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/build-linux.sh appimage
bash scripts/build-linux.sh flatpak
bash scripts/build-linux.sh deb
```

macOS:

```bash
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
```

Android:

```bash
bash scripts/build-android.sh apk
bash scripts/build-android.sh bundle
```

Android SDK packaging for release distribution:

```bash
bash scripts/build-android-sdk.sh
```

iOS:

```bash
bash scripts/build-ios.sh false
```

The desktop build scripts fetch and verify the pinned Tor Browser and i2pd assets before packaging. If you intentionally want to skip that step for a local build, set `SKIP_TOR_I2P_FETCH=1`.

Development notes
-----------------

- The generated Flutter FFI files live under `app/lib/core/ffi/generated/`.
- The app loads translations from `app/assets/i18n/`.
- Rust quality checks:

```bash
cd crates
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features --locked
```

Release and verification outputs
--------------------------------

Project scripts also generate or consume:

- SHA-256 checksum files for release artifacts
- SBOMs via `scripts/generate-sbom.sh`
- provenance files via `scripts/generate-provenance.sh`

For verification and release handling details, use the documents under `docs/` rather than this README.
