# Release Process

This document describes the release process for Stashi Wallet as it is implemented in this repository.

Release inputs
--------------

Before building release artifacts:

- set the upcoming application baseline in `app/pubspec.yaml` so local and
  non-tag builds identify themselves accurately
- ensure Rust, Flutter, and dependency checks pass
- ensure platform signing inputs are available where required
- ensure release notes and published checksums will be prepared with the artifacts
- update `release-artifacts.toml` for any backend deliverable that should publish on the next tag:
  - `cli`
  - `qortal_cli`
  - `qortal_jni`
  - `native_ffi`
  - `ios_sdk`
  - `android_sdk`
  - `react_native_plugin`

Versioning from tags
--------------------

Release builds use `scripts/sync-version-from-tag.sh` before platform packaging.

For a tag such as:

```text
v1.1.1
```

the script updates `app/pubspec.yaml` for the build so that Flutter platform metadata uses:

- build name: `1.1.1`
- build number: `10101` by default (`major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`),
  unless `VERSION_BUILD_NUMBER` is set

That version then flows into:

- Android `versionName` and `versionCode`
- iOS `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion`
- macOS `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion`
- Windows `FileVersion` and `ProductVersion`
- the in-app settings version display via `package_info_plus`

Rust build info used by the Verify Build screen is also resolved from `app/pubspec.yaml`, so it matches the app release version instead of the crate workspace version.

The committed baseline prevents ordinary development builds from falling back
to an obsolete release number. Tag builds still resolve the tag independently,
and malformed `v...` tags fail packaging instead of silently publishing with
the baseline version.

Backend artifact version gating
-------------------------------

Backend deliverables are not published on every GUI tag by default.

The workflow compares `release-artifacts.toml` in the current tag against the previous tag.

Publication is gated by the backend artifact versions in that file:

- `cli`
- `qortal_cli`
- `qortal_jni`
- `native_ffi`
- `ios_sdk`
- `android_sdk`
- `react_native_plugin`

Practical effect:

- frontend-only GUI release: GUI artifacts publish, backend artifacts stay unchanged
- backend/service release: publish the backend artifacts whose versions changed

Required checks
---------------

Run the checks appropriate to the platform and the changes in the release:

```bash
cd crates
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features --locked
cd ..

cd app
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
flutter analyze
cd ..
```

Platform build scripts
----------------------

Use the committed build scripts under `scripts/` for release packaging.

Windows:

```bash
bash scripts/build-windows.sh
```

Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/build-linux.sh appimage
bash scripts/build-linux.sh flatpak
bash scripts/build-linux.sh deb
```

Linux AppImage and Debian artifacts target Ubuntu 22.04 (`GLIBC_2.35`). The
release script scans the complete Flutter bundle, including Rust, KDF, Tor, and
I2P executables, and fails packaging if any ELF exceeds that ABI ceiling. Do not
replace the pinned Linux runner with a floating image without providing an
equivalent Ubuntu 22.04 sysroot or build container.

The AppImage embeds a checksum-pinned, statically linked type-2 runtime. The
packager rejects runtimes with shared-library dependencies or the legacy
`libfuse.so.2` loader marker, then verifies that the approved runtime is the
exact byte prefix of the finished artifact. This lets the AppImage launch on
modern FUSE installations without requiring the separately packaged legacy
`libfuse2` library. A host that has no usable FUSE kernel interface at all must
use the Debian/Flatpak package or AppImage's explicit extract-and-run fallback;
that host limitation cannot be removed by an AppImage payload.

macOS:

```bash
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
```

Android:

```bash
bash scripts/build-android.sh apk
bash scripts/build-android.sh bundle
```

iOS:

```bash
bash scripts/build-ios.sh true
```

Backend artifacts:

```bash
bash scripts/build-cli.sh
bash scripts/build-native-ffi.sh
bash scripts/build-android-sdk.sh
bash scripts/build-ios-sdk.sh
```

Android SDK packaging publishes two layers:

- the AAR at `bindings/android-sdk/build/outputs/aar/pirate-android-sdk-release.aar`
- the source/package bundle at `dist/android-sdk/pirate-android-sdk-package.zip`

On tagged releases, CI includes the AAR and package zip in the release when `release-artifacts.toml` marks `android_sdk` as changed.

Nix-backed native entry points
------------------------------

The repository flake exposes the same native packaging paths through Nix:

- Linux hosts
  - `nix build .#linux-appimage`
  - `nix build .#linux-flatpak`
  - `nix build .#linux-deb`
  - `nix build .#android-apk`
  - `nix build .#android-bundle`
- macOS hosts
  - `nix build .#macos-dmg`
  - `nix build .#ios-ipa`

Windows packaging remains script-driven through `scripts/build-windows.sh`.

Signing behavior
----------------

Signing behavior depends on platform and environment:

- Apple release signing is opt-in:
  - set the repository variable `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED` to exactly `true` to enable macOS signing and notarization
  - set the repository variable `IOS_SIGNING_ENABLED` to exactly `true` to enable iOS signing and TestFlight upload
  - leaving either variable unset or setting it to any other value keeps that platform's signing disabled even when old secrets still exist
  - enabling signing without all required platform secrets fails the signing job instead of silently falling back
- Windows
  - signing is controlled by the variables consumed by `scripts/build-windows.sh`
  - unsigned artifacts are produced when signing inputs are not present
- macOS
  - `scripts/build-macos.sh` supports Developer ID signing and optional notarization
  - when release signing is disabled, the release publishes `Stashi-Wallet-macos-unsigned.dmg`
- Android
  - `scripts/build-android.sh` signs only when keystore inputs are provided
- iOS
  - `scripts/build-ios.sh true` requires a valid Xcode signing configuration
  - when release signing is disabled, the unsigned IPA is kept in `Stashi-Wallet-mobile-store-test-builds.zip`; it is not a normal-user installable

---------------

Current script outputs are:

- Windows
  - `Stashi-Wallet-windows-installer.exe`
  - `Stashi-Wallet-windows-installer-unsigned.exe`
  - `Stashi-Wallet-windows-portable-unsigned.zip` (CI/test artifact)

  - `libpirate_ffi_native.so`
  - `pirate_ffi_native.dll`
  - `pirate_wallet_service.h`
  - `PirateWalletNative.xcframework.zip`
  - Android SDK `.aar`
  - Android SDK Maven repo zip
  - Android SDK package zip

Published GitHub Release layout
-------------------------------

GitHub Releases present assets as one flat list, so the publish workflow keeps only normal-user downloads at the top level and groups the rest into bundles.

Top-level release assets are:

- signed Windows installer, with an unsigned installer fallback only when signing is unavailable
- Linux AppImage, deb, and Flatpak packages
- signed macOS DMG, with an unsigned fallback only when signing is unavailable
- signed Android split APKs for direct installation
- signed iOS IPA when available
- `PirateWalletNative.xcframework.zip` and `PirateWalletSDK-Package.swift` only when the iOS SDK changes, because Swift Package Manager binary targets need a direct release URL
- `Stashi-Wallet-release-metadata.zip`
- `signatures-<tag>.zip`
- `pirate-unified-wallet-developer-artifacts.zip` when developer artifacts were produced

The unsigned portable Windows build is retained in
`Stashi-Wallet-unsigned-desktop-test-builds.zip` for testing and
reproducible verification. It is not published as a normal-user download.

`Stashi-Wallet-release-metadata.zip` contains:

- `README` with checksum and detached-signature verification instructions
- `SHA256SUMS` with one entry for every top-level release asset
- `checksums/` with `.sha256` files for every top-level release asset
- `public-keys/` with the official armored release-verification key
- `raw/` with the original checksums, detached signatures, SBOMs, provenance files, verification notes, and optional VirusTotal reports from the package jobs

`signatures-<tag>.zip` follows the established Treasure Chest filename and
verification layout, but is signed exclusively by the Stashi Wallet
release key. It contains:

- `README` with verification commands
- `public_key.asc` for the established release-key UID
  `Pirate Unified Wallet <dev@piratechainfoundation.com>`
- `sha256sum-<tag>.txt` and its binary detached `.sig`
- one binary detached `<release-asset>.sig` for every top-level release asset
- a signed `build-payloads-<tag>.txt` manifest when desktop installed-payload
  hashes are available for the in-app verifier

`pirate-unified-wallet-developer-artifacts.zip` contains grouped folders for CLI tools, native FFI libraries, SDK packages, store/test mobile builds, and unsigned desktop test builds. These are intentionally not top-level user downloads.

Checksums, SBOMs, and provenance
--------------------------------

After packaging, generate or verify release metadata:

```bash
scripts/generate-sbom.sh dist/sbom
scripts/generate-provenance.sh <artifact> dist/provenance
```

Each published release should include readable checksum data for the distributed artifacts. The Verify Build screen and desktop updater depend on that, and both support checksums inside `Stashi-Wallet-release-metadata.zip`.

Release publication checklist
-----------------------------

- artifacts built from committed sources
- checksums and detached signatures published in `signatures-<tag>.zip`
- release public-key fingerprint matches `E4FB 2399 AECC F9B9 447D ED47 2CE6 5343 4015 53A6`
- release notes prepared
- signed artifacts used where intended
- unsigned artifacts retained where deterministic verification is needed
- updater asset names match the published artifact names
- Verify Build can resolve published checksums for the release
